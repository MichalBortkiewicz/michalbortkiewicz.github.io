# Michał Bortkiewicz

I'm a PhD student in deep learning researching continual learning at Warsaw University of Technology. I recently started working as a deep learning engineer at Samsung Research on audio intelligence projects, including sound recognition. Previously, I have worked on computer vision applications used in Scope Fluidics for medical diagnostics and on classic machine learning solutions for aircraft logistics in Airspace Intelligence.
Even though I started my academic career with exams at the Architecture faculty, I eventually finished with a master’s in Data Science. In the meantime, I studied a few fields, including Aerospace Engineering, Informatics, Automatics and Robotics (B.Eng.), and Data Science (M.Sc.Eng.). This academic journey helped me determine my interests and drive toward AI. Thus I began my PhD.

I recently worked as a deep learning engineer at Samsung Research on audio intelligence projects, including sound recognition in a Few Shot Learning scenario. Previously, I worked on computer vision applications used in Scope Fluidics for medical diagnostics and on machine learning solutions for aircraft logistics in Airspace Intelligence. My professional career started with an internship in Space Forest during my undergrad studies while developing PID controller for small rocket. Currently, my main area of research focuses on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in Continual Learning. In particular, I am interested in making multi-level agents reason on different time scales while maintaining previously learned skills and transferring them to novel tasks.

I read biographies, sci-fi, and scientific books on various topics, especially astronomy, physics, and ML, when I find some free time. My favorite sports activities are squash or tennis, but I also started Kickboxing recently, and I love it. I also play guitar and record ideas occasionally; I dream of recording my EP one day ;)
